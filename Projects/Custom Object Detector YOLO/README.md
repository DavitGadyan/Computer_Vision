# Custom Object Detector YOLO

## Description

This project aims to create custom object classifier to capture any defined object based on YOLO framework.

In this mini-project with model trained just on 100 images we want to detect guns on images and as we will see we are able even with such small data.

As you can see results are not perfect but they can be easily be improved as training time was around 30 mins and number of training set just 100 samples.
As in computer vision data and computation are the most important points!
